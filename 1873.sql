#1873. Calculate Special Bonus

#Write an SQL query to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.

#Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

#The query result format is in the following example.

# Write your MySQL query statement below

   select employee_id , 
   case when employee_id%2 <>0 and name not like 'M%' then salary 
   else 0
   end 
   as bonus
   from employees
   order by employee_id;
